      <p>
        Hello! I am Mariana and to be honest and cut through the self promotion bit, my career up until now has had little to do with web development.
        I often got other people to do that for me. But, bottom line, I am always looking to do things myself, so this was the way forward.
        If it pays off we will see.

  <h2 style="color:darkgray;"> <em> My Passions & Focus.</em></h2>
    <p>
      My passion lies in <strong>storytelling</strong>, in creating all types of media and web content that incite <strong> innovation</strong>, further <strong> a message </strong> and enable <strong> change</strong>. In the humanitarian field, the right storytelling helps humanitarian workers to realise their mandate and aid those that need most. In other fields, storytelling enables people to connect with a product, an idea or a solution that make their lives better, their families happier and their community thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
    I like to think of me as the <strong>conductor</strong> who builds and orchestrates the team of skilled artists who can give life to <strong> media content</strong> with the purpose of <em>improving lives and aiding solution-building efforts</em> across the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>My focus </strong>is to look for talented artists and creatives from all walks of life to <strong> build effective and high performing teams.</strong>
